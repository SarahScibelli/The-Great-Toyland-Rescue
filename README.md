# The-Great-Toyland-Rescue
The Great Toyland Rescue is a first-person shooter where you play as a toy in a childâ€™s bedroom. The player must traverse the bedroom by finding keys to unlock new areas while also fighting enemy toys. Once the player reaches the last section, they must defeat a final boss to win the game.


The controls involve using WASD to move, spacebar to jump, and left click to shoot.

The Great Toyland Rescue was developed in Unity and programmed in c# using Visual Studio Code. The Game was made to run on PC and was developed by Sarah Scibelli.
